# Bored Game

Feeling bored?

How about a board game?

Use this app to search for a board game to play because you are bored apparently.

## Developing

Once you've checked out the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Building for production?

Great! Run:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
